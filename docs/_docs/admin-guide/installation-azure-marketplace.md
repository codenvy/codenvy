You can installation Codenvy Enterprise from VMs that are hosted on the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/codenvy/codenvy-on-prem/).
# Get a Codenvy VM  
In order to ensure you have the most up-to-date version available you must first install Codenvy onto your VM.
