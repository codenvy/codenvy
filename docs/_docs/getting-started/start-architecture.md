Codenvy is cloud workspaces for development teams. Codenvy is available for self-service at codenvy.io (hosted and managed by us). You can also install Codenvy on your own infrastructure with by downloading Codenvy.

Most of these docs refer equally to the hosted system at codenvy.io and a Codenvy on-premises installation. To avoid confusion each page inclues an "Applies to:" section at the top.

Codenvy is a commercial offering based on the Eclipse Che open source project, so Eclipse Che workspaces and plug-ins will work within Codenvy. 

Codenvy has added enterprise features to Eclipse Che including:

- User authentication, single-sign on, and LDAP
- Workspace distribution across multiple containers with an embedded Docker Swarm for scaling
- Team management, permissions and resource policy management tools
- Operational solutions for monitoring, scaling, upgrading and archiving workspaces
- Self-service user registration
- Workspace automation and JIRA, Jenkins and other integrations

You will periodically see references to Eclipse Che in these docs.
